  <h1>How To Use USB Over Network Software</h1>
  <p>This article will explain how to use USB over network software, allowing individuals to manage their USB devices with a <a href="https://www.flexihub.com/usb-over-network/">USB over Network Software</a>. This USB over network client is called FlexiHub.</p>

  <p>With a free subscription to this USB over network software, users can easily connect and share their USB devices. However, <b>for those who wish to use a Linux operating system as their platform for sharing connected peripheral devices over RDP, a paid subscription will be necessary.</b></p>

  <p>Once users create their preferred account, follow the steps below to connect to remote devices:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>On the computers physically connected to the desired USB devices/dongles, and the computer that will require remote access (call the “client” using RDP), download and install FlexiHub</li>
    <li>Launch and login to the FlexiHub app on both computers (login credentials will be the same for both launching and logging into FlexiHub- this includes logging in on the FlexiHub website)</li>
    <li>Launch USB over Network software (note: logging into a FlexiHub account on the FlexiHub website is only necessary if users want to manage their account or select the number of connections they need)</li>
    <li>On the remote machine, find the desired USB devices from within the FlexiHub app</li>
    <li>Click “Connect”</li>
    <li>Locate the device in FlexiHub</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Once the connection is established, users can freely access their USB devices remotely, enjoying the same control and functionality that one would experience if the device was physically connected to the client machine in use.</p>

  <p><b>Please note:</b> Default settings enable all client nodes to access any USB devices connected to the USB ports on a computer <b>actively logged into the user’s FlexiHub account</b>. Users can limit access by implementing password protection on specified devices connected with USB ports, thus preventing use by anyone without the password. It is also possible to “lock” devices, preventing all remote access entirely.</p>

  </ul>
